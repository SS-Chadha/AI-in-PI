## Literature Review on the Physical Internet: A New Logistics Paradigm

The Physical Internet (PI) is an emerging logistics and supply chain management (SCM) concept that aims to revolutionize existing practices by drawing on technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and key performance indicators[1][2][5]. The PI was conceptualized as a response to the inefficiencies and unsustainability of current logistics and SCM practices, which suffer from issues like underutilized vehicles and facilities, congested infrastructure, and high greenhouse gas emissions[4].

The core idea behind the PI is to reorganize logistics networks to increase their efficiency, similar to how the digital internet revolutionized the flow of information[1][4]. This involves the use of standardized, modular, and intelligent containers that can be routed through an interconnected system of transportation, storage, and handling resources, much like data packets on the internet[4]. The deployment of the PI is expected to lead to a profound transformation of logistics networks and resources, with significant impacts on the design and operation of logistics facilities and material handling systems[4].

Recent literature reviews have identified several key themes in PI research, including the implementation of the PI in different regions, the optimization of operations in PI hubs, the development of centralized reputation-based transportation auctions, and the impacts and challenges related to the shift towards open logistics networks[1][5]. However, these reviews have been limited in scope, omitting many relevant publications and failing to comprehensively address the evolution of the PI literature and the identification of future research directions[1][5].

To address these gaps, a more holistic and inclusive systematic literature review is needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the PI literature, identify major themes and methods, and suggest future research directions and approaches[1][5]. Such a review would contribute to the growth of PI research and the exploration of new, innovative supply chain models and strategies[1][5].
